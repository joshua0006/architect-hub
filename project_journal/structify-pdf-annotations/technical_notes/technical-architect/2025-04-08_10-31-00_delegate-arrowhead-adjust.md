**Context:** Adjusting arrowhead appearance in `drawArrow` function (`src/utils/drawingUtils.ts`) based on user feedback.

**Details:**
User requested smaller arrowheads and prevention of overlap between the line and the arrowhead.

Delegated the task to the `code` mode via `new_task`. The task involved modifying `drawArrow`:
1.  Reducing `baseHeadLength` from 10 to 8 to decrease arrowhead size.
2.  Calculating a new endpoint for the main line, shortened by half the scaled line width along the line's direction, to prevent overlap with the arrowhead base.
3.  Updating the line drawing call to use the new shortened endpoint.

The `code` mode successfully completed these modifications.

**Rationale:**
Delegation was necessary due to mode-specific file editing permissions. The `code` mode is appropriate for implementing these visual adjustments in the drawing utility function.
