**Context:** Applying line thickness styling to annotation previews (Line, Arrow, Double Arrow) in `AnnotationCanvas.tsx`.

**Details:**
Attempted to modify `src/components/AnnotationCanvas.tsx` directly using `apply_diff` but encountered a mode restriction error. The `technical-architect` mode cannot edit `.tsx` files.

Delegated the task to the `code` mode via `new_task`. The task involved:
1.  Modifying `AnnotationCanvas.tsx` to pass the `currentStyle` object to `drawLine` and `drawArrow` preview calls.
2.  Modifying `drawingUtils.ts` to update `drawLine` and `drawArrow` signatures to accept the `style` object and use `style.lineWidth`, `style.color`, and `style.opacity` internally.

The `code` mode successfully completed these modifications.

**Rationale:**
Delegation was necessary due to mode-specific file editing permissions. The `code` mode is appropriate for implementing these changes.
