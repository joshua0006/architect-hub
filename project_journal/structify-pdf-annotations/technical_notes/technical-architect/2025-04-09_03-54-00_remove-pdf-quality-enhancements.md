**Context:** Modification of PDF rendering quality in `PDFViewer.tsx`.

**Details:**
The user requested that the PDF viewer should display documents at their original uploaded quality, without any automatic enhancements. Several code sections in `PDFViewer.tsx` were identified as contributing to quality enhancement:
1.  A dynamic `qualityMultiplier` based on zoom level.
2.  Canvas context settings for `imageSmoothingEnabled` and `imageSmoothingQuality`.
3.  Use of the `"print"` rendering `intent` at higher zoom levels.

**Action Taken:**
Delegated the task to the `code` mode to modify `PDFViewer.tsx`. The `code` mode successfully:
1.  Set `qualityMultiplier` to a constant `1.0`.
2.  Removed the `imageSmoothingEnabled` and `imageSmoothingQuality` settings.
3.  Set the rendering `intent` to always be `"display"`.

**Rationale:**
These changes ensure that the PDF rendering process does not apply any upscaling, smoothing, or alternative rendering intents that might alter the visual quality from the original document. The viewer will now prioritize displaying the PDF as-is.

**Next Steps:**
None. The requested change is implemented.
