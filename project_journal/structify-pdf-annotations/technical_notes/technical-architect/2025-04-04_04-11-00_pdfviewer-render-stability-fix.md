**Context:** User reported an unspecified error in `src/components/PDFViewer.tsx` after previous attempts to fix rendering clarity.

**Analysis:**
Reviewing the code revealed that the `useCallback` hook defining `renderPdfPage` included the `renderAttempts` state variable in its dependency array (line ~695).

**Identified Issue:**
Including component state (`renderAttempts`) in the `useCallback` dependency array for `renderPdfPage` makes the function reference unstable. It changes every time a render retry occurs, which likely causes cascading issues with debouncing and effect hook triggers that depend on `renderPdfPage`.

**Proposed Fix:**
- Remove `renderAttempts` from the `useCallback` dependency array for `renderPdfPage`. The retry logic is internal to the function and should not affect its identity.

**Rationale:**
Stabilizing the `renderPdfPage` function reference is crucial for the correct functioning of `useCallback`, `debounce`, and `useEffect` hooks that rely on it. This should prevent unexpected re-renders and potential race conditions caused by the unstable function reference.

**Next Steps:**
- Code change delegated to `code` mode (Task completed).
- User to re-test the component after the fix is applied.
